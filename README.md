# social-network-influence-optimization
Project Description:
Given a social network represented as an undirected graph, where users are either influencers or haters, the goal is to select a subset of influencers—within a given budget—that maximizes the spread of the brand "Pradducci" across the network. The selection must avoid negatively impacting the brand by reaching hater nodes, while optimizing brand exposure through strategic influence.
