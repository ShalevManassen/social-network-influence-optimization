# social-network-influence-optimization
Project Description:
Given a social network represented as an undirected graph, where users are either influencers or haters, the goal is to select a subset of influencers—within a given budget—that maximizes the spread of the brand "Pradducci" across the network. The selection must avoid negatively impacting the brand by reaching hater nodes, while optimizing brand exposure through strategic influence.

The input of the project (csv files):
costs: A list of influencers along with how much each one costs.
haters: A list of users who are haters of the brand.
NoseBook_friendships: A list of friendships in an undirected graph.
Each tuple represents a mutual friendship between two users.
